'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
    #counter starting at 0
    #if length of word is 0
        #return 0
    #elif word[0] == 't'
        #count += 1 and recurse again, word[1:]
    #else
        #just recurse again word[1:]
        
    #return count
